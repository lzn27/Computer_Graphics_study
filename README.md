The last time I update this repository is on the evening of Mar 1 2018, and it's 1:15am on April 1 2020 now. I am trying to update this repository after fixing a bug hidden in a piece of code written by OpenGL, which took me hours. Yes, I am a greenhand. Two years have passed. I eventually enter computer graphics. And hours ago, I just graduated from ZJU whose CG is excellent. Life is tough. Chance is fleeting. Keep working. Stay foolish.
